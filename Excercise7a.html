<img src= "Movie3.jpg" width="150" height="120" style="padding: 20px; float: left;"
<p>Dominic and his crew thought they'd left the criminal mercenary life behind. They'd defeated international terrorist Owen Shaw and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, is out killing the crew one by one for revenge. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde and a shady government official called "Mr. Nobody" are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called "God's Eye," that can turn any technological device into a weapon. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between the terrorist and the United States government.

<h2 id="Movie4">How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming (2019)</h2>
<img src= "Movie4.jpg" width="150" height="120" style="padding: 20px; float: left;"
<p>It's the festival of Snoggletog on New Berk, but Hiccup isn't feeling the holiday spirit. First, he misses his friend Toothless; second, he has just found out that his daughter Zephyr and his son Nuffink have found Stoick's old journals (written before Vikings and dragons became friends) and now believe that all dragons are dangerous and should be destroyed. To help him possibly change their minds, Astrid suggests reviving the old traditions of Snoggletog, including a play in which Stoick the Vast's memory will be honored and (perhaps) the children's minds changed. Meanwhile on the Hidden World island, Toothless, through the use of sand drawings, tells his three Night Light children about his best friend Hiccup, inspiring them to make a secret flight to New Berk to see for themselves.</p>
