<h2 style="text-align: center;">This is a best prospect industry sector for this country. Includes a market overview and trade data</h2>
<h2><b>Overview<br></b></h2>
<h2>The Philippine Government has identified better connectivity and promoting ease of doing business among its priorities.  President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly reminded Government officials and the private sector about improving their services.  He instructed the search for a third telecom operator to address the duopoly between the Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Globe Telecom.  On May 2018, President Duterte signed Republic Act (RA) No. 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act.  This law aims to streamline government procedures and services and solve what President Duterte calls “the perennial problem of red tape”.  RA 11032 was crafted to attract more foreign investments to the Philippines and to fast-track the establishment of new businesses.  These developments are expected to boost investments in information technology products and services and capital expenditure for telecommunications networks.
